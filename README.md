What are the types of merge available with git? Explain them 
Git provides various methods to merge different commits into a base commit. These methods are called Merge Strategies In fast forward, history is just one straight line. When you create a branch, make some commits in that branch, the time you’re ready to merge, there is no new merge on the master. A three-way merge involves three snapshots. Two are the ones that are involved in a two-way merge, and the third one is the base file or the common ancestor with which these two files will be compared.
